Solr service isn't running after initial install, though the output from chef-solo indicates it's started successfully.

No Rails logs. /srv/rapid_ftr/shared/log is supposed to be owned by 'nobody' so passenger can write to it, but after first boot up it's owned by 'root' so the log can't be created.
Manually `sudo chown nobody /srv/rapid_ftr/shared/log` fixes it.

Admin group is expected but may not exist. (Group exists on vagrant and Canonical EC2 image but not on Linode.)

Nginx tries to redirect http requests to an internal name on port 443. Fully qualified domain name should possibly be overridden in local node.json. Currently chef tries to figure this out gets an internal name.
